## Description:

The Laserball Machine, is a digital game to play with friends from the [Ideia à Vista](http://ideiaavista.com.br/){:target="_blank"} company. Made with wood trim and suede provides a unique experience for players.

A new concept in video game. Invite a friend to play, get beers randomly chosen by the machine and have fun like never before!

The main team was composed by Beto Roa, Renato Roa, João Ricardo Bittencourt and Tobias Ulrich (me). In this project I was the programmer.
My old boss (Beto Roa) was the game designer and producer, Renato was the artist and João (professor) was the main programmer.

It is a huge and nice project!
