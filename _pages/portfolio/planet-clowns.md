### Description:

You and your friends are survivors of a spaceship crash in the Planet of the Clowns. Hordes of clowns are attacking the ship. Luckily, the Mimes (archenemys of the clown people) are next to the crash and will help you with equipment in exchange for clowns’ heads. It's time to kick some ass!

Tiago Junges was the main Game Designer and I was the artist and the apprentice.
