![Alt Rhythmos Engine 1.1v]({{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/{{page.ogimage}})

After three years, I finally upgraded **[Rhythmos Engine](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/39835){:target="_blank"}** for Unity.

I promised to myself, that it would only update if any user reports a bug or requests for new feature.
So, the outdated version of _Rhythmos Engine_ was built targeting the Unity 3.5.0 and higher versions.
But now we have Unity 5 and a few issues due to incompatibility.

**Change-log:**

- DLLs updated to Unity 4.6.0f version.
- Few changes for compatibility for Unity 5 and higher versions.
- .NET framework was changed from 4.0 to 3.5 version.
- BPM now is float type.

**Do you want new features? Are you having issues?**

Please give me feedback that I'll gladly answer you and maybe we can improve the engine.

:)
