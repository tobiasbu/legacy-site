Greetings internet!

I always wanted to create my own clean and _programmer like_ website.
So, a [friend of mine](https://lucas.ninja/){:target="_blank"} presented me [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} and I could do that.
Now, new time come!

Here we're! :)

I hosting this website as [GitHub](https://github.com/tobiasbu){:target="_blank"} page projects and I migrate from my [old WordPress](https://tobiasbu.wordpress.com/){:target="_blank"} blog to Jekyll.

I also recreated my _brand_ - the _Tobi's tree_ - just because my favorite color is green and love trees.
