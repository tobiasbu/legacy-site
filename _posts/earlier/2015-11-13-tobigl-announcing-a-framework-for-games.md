When I met the OpenGL in Computer Graphics class it was love at first sight. Somehow, I coded many classes to handle matrices, textures, meshes and another stuff. That made me have a great desire to learn more about OpenGL. And for me the best way to learn is in practice. Asking myself: why not build a game framework using OpenGL? I know that on the Internet there are several things about it. But I'm crazy a lot for improve my code knowledge especially in computer graphics.

I present the **tobiGL**! A future friendly game framework.

## Why a dog in the logo

<p>My nickname is Tobi and some people <span id="result_box" class="short_text" lang="en"><span class="hps alt-edited">told me</span> <span class="hps alt-edited">that it is</span> a <span class="hps">dog name. Playing with it I made this logo. I think dogs are friendly and <span class="hps alt-edited">trustworthy</span>. I hope this framework can be good to code as a good dog.</span></span></p>

## What is in mind:

<ul>
<li>Programming Language C++;</li>
<li>Cross-Platform? No, for now. I have no ideia how to implement.  Only Windows.</li>
<li>Repository in GitHub or BitBucket;</li>
<li>This will not be a complete framework. The main goal here is self learning;</li>
<li>Focus in 2D games. 3D is very hard to manage;</li>
<li>Managers for un/loading images, sounds, models... all "behind the curtains".</li>
<li>It will be use the following libraries:
<ul>
<li>Modern OpenGL above 3.30 versions.</li>
<li>glfw - window and event handling;</li>
<li>glew - OpenGL extension wrangler library;</li>
<li>FreeType - fonts and text rendering purpose;</li>
<li>stb, FreeImage or SOIL - images libraries;</li>
<li>Irrklang - high level sound 2D or 3D library;</li>
<li>Network module?  One more thing that I need to learn.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Licensing: I need to read about in http://oss-watch.ac.uk/ and http://opensource.org/licenses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Next steps:</strong></p>
<p>Well, I'm current in the end of semester in university. Lot of things to do. When summer vacation starts I will back to this topic and starting this journey!</p>
