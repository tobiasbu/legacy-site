<p>The year of 2015 was nice. I developed few good projects. I continue having the problem with time: my personal life X projects (like this blog) X university X work. However I have trying do my best.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>

## First semester:

<p>Starting with my new "sweetheart" game: <strong><a href="{{site.baseurl | append: "/portfolio/koko-kuba/"}}" target="_blank">Koko-Kuba</a></strong>!</p>
<p>This game it's about a tribe of fishes moved by music. They must go to the dark seas and battle against the villains. Basically the player need to make rhythms to move the tribe and be careful with obstacles and enemies.</p>
<p>Koko-Kuba is under development. I want to implement nice stuff to do a big release. :)<br />
I'm writing a Dev Diary about it. Unfortunately the first post is in portuguese.</p>

## Second Semester:

<p>For this semester, I wrote into topics:</p>

- **[Game Of Potatoes]({{site.baseurl | append: "/portfolio/game-of-potatoes/"}}):** A RTS game with potatoes guys! In this time I was the artist. At moment I don't have any build. :-(

- **[VRSoccer]({{site.baseurl | append: "/portfolio/vrsoccer/"}}):** This project was created for university. Me and a professor developed a virtual reality soccer game using Unity3D and OpenCV. It was really nice! Check the video bellow:

- **Computer Graphics:** Ah! Computer Graphics! Every semester when I see this subject I love it more and more. I learned more about OpenGL 4 and shaders. I will post in the near future.

- **Random:** At the end of the year I restart to draw. A long time ago when a was a child I used to draw everywhere. <span class="hps">Time passed and</span> look! A habit came back. During this summer vacation I drawed this cat:

Welcome 2016!

I hope that we can be friends! As a professor say:*"Avante!"* - Keep moving forward!

:)
