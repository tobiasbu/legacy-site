![Me]({{site.baseurl}}/img/portrait.png){: style="width:180px"}

Hey! I'm Tobias Beise Ulrich, a software and game developer from Brazil. 

I consider myself a generalist programmer working with different solutions and technologies with 5+ years of professional experience.
I recently graduated in Game Development from <a href="http://www.unisinos.br/global/en/" target="_blank">UNISINOS</a>.

My main interests are explore technical implementations of game engines, software architecture and
develop interactive/graphical applications.

Currently I’m looking for new opportunities. If you are interested in my work get in touch. 

[Here]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/resume-TobiasUlrich.pdf) you can find my résumé.
