## Description

This game is a test of my own [framework](https://github.com/tobiasbu/tobiJS){:target="_blank"} for web-based games.
The main idea was testing the basic concepts of a game engine architecture. Of course it is hard to create a game engine from scratch.
I'm the kind of guy who likes to learn about everything about programming. Well, it was challenging enough!

I developing a new version of this game for mobile devices using Unity (yes, own game engines are difficult!).
