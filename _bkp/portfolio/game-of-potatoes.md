## Description

In this time I was the artist. Most of arts of this game I created using Inkscape and GIMP. Game created with C++ and Cocos2D.
Game of Potatoes was created during the second semester of 2015 in the Cross-Platform course. The team was composed by two programmers and one artist (me). The game itself is really simple.

You need to command a potatoes army against other potatoes armies. Some features are missing or werenâ€™t implemented because the API reference of Cocos2D is bad. At least we have gained a good experience.
