## Source code

## Description

OdalricBot is a Terran StarCraft BroodWar bot written from scratch in C++ based on BWAPI 4.1.2.

The architeture is based on managers strongly inspired on [UAlbertaBot](https://github.com/davechurchill/ualbertabot){:target="_blank"} and [Steamhammer](http://satirist.org/ai/starcraft/steamhammer/){:target="_blank"}.

Development focused on the robustness and expansion of the architecture. However, given the short development time, the bot efficiency is unbalanced.

## Features

- Workers Manager;
- Scouting: find the enemy base;
- Terrain Analyzer that runs in background, analyzing and classifying the tiles in 'buildable' or walkable and search for best place for future bases; 
- Resource Area Manager: find all minerals and geysers available in the map creating Resources Zones; 
- Building and Build Plan Managers;
- Commander Manager: order next actions from Strategy Manager and Tactics Data; 
- Utilities classes: Math, Quick Commands, Draw, Debugging, IO and more... 

## Architecture

The follow image shows the final architecture approach. There is a lot of features that is missing mainly about the Combat manager and continuous strategies.
