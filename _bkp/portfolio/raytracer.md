## Description

The Raytracer was made for Advanced Computer Graphics Techniques class on the college. 
This project involves to create a entire system of algorithms to render three-dimensional images using the **backward Raytracing technique**.

The ray tracer is based on **light paths** as well as in the real world, simulating effects according to the objects characteristics. It's capable to generate high degree of realism, but it has a great computational cost.

## Raytracer Project

In this section itâ€™s presented a bit of the project implementation: 

### Workflow

1. Rays are traced from one observer to each pixel on a virtual screen.
2. Each ray must test intersection with scene objects
3. When intersecting with the nearest object, the color is calculated from light sources examining the object's material properties with mixing (or shading) the information to the final pixel color.
4. Reflective, refractory or transcluded materials and also, high shadows generation will require more rays to trace.

### Pseudo-Code

The raytracer algorithm can be implemented in the following way:

{% pseudocode %}
Function render()
  For Each image pixel
  // Compute ray Direction for current Pixel based on the Camera;
  ray <- camera.Compute_Ray()
  // Trace the computed Ray on the scene where:
  tCloser <- $infinity
  objectCloser <- @null

  For Each object
    If ray.Intersects(object)
        If ray distance < tCloser
            objectCloser <- object // closer object
            tCloser <- distance // intersection distance

  finalColor <- backgroundColor

  If objectCloser != @null
    // With the closest intersected object
    // Compute light contribution for each light source in the scene.
    For Each light source  
        lightContrib <- light.Compute_Contribution(ray)
        // Compute shading of the closer object Material.
        finalColor <- objectCloser.Shading(ray, lightContrib)

    image.Set_Pixel(finalColor);
  Else
    // Otherwise, not object intersected.
    // Fill current pixel with background color
    image.Set_Pixel(finalColor);
{% endpseudocode %}


### Acceleration Structures

Depending in the scene, in overall the ray tracer algorithm is slow. 
Imagine that we want to render a scene with thousands of primitives. The traditional raytracer algorithm is very slow and unpractical.
How we can dealing with it? **Acceleration Structures** is the answer!

There is a lot of alternatives for structures. In this project I choose to implement **Boundig Box Hierarchy - BVH**.

BVH is a spatial partitioning binary tree, from _"bounding volumes"_. For each object, there is a delimiter volume that extends by forming the maximum boundaries of the object.
There are several variations and optimizations, even for real-time use. 

### Optimizing

To optimize the render routine of the raytracer there more points to consider. In this project I added the following items:

#### 1. BVH - Surface Area Heuristics

It is a BVH division method, which seeks to **minimize** the time spent during the rays intersections.
While the BVH is built, it is estimated whether it is better to create a leaf node or divide the node by checking the child nodes.

The cost of each node is **proportional to the area of the bounding volume** and the number of primitives that the node contains.
The best division minimizes the cost of each node. However, this method **increases the time** of BVH construction.
This same algorithm is used in _kD-tree_.

#### 2. Polygonal mesh sub-division

Specific BVH for mesh. It follows the same principle of a the scene BVH's, however for each polygon of a mesh a bounding volume is created.

#### 3. Parallel ray tracing

To speed up the ray tracing process, we subdivide the image buffer by number `n` threads.
Each thread is responsible for treating ray tracing with a "piece" of buffer.

## Future Improvements

There are several issues and improvements to do in this project:
- First, create a UI for scene management (using [imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) or similiar). It's pretty bad to edit _.TXT_ files to edit the scene elements.
- It will be interesting to have a node graph editor for shaders materials which deploys to the raytracer engine and OpenGL.
- The parallel raytracing is not speeding up properly as expected. At this point require some research.
- Also we will gain more speed if we implement the render routines on **hardware accelerators** such as [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) or [OpenCL](https://www.amd.com/pt-br/solutions/professional/hpc/opencl)
- Some files loaders as _Wavefront *.OBJ Loader_ is very slow in some cases. Requires improvement and detection of bad meshes.
- And of course, error handling and unit test will be welcome.
